	When I ^{C\,\,}find myself in ^{G\,\,\,\,\,\,}times of trouble

	^{Ami\,\,\,\,}Mother Mary ^{Fmaj7\,\,}comes to me
	
	^{C\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,}Speaking words of ^{G\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,}wisdom: ``Let it ^{F}be.'' ^{C\,Dmi7\,C}
	
	^{C}And in my hour of ^{G\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,}darkness

	She is ^{Ami\,\,\,\,}standing right in ^{Fmaj7}front of me

	^{C\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,}Speaking words of ^{G\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,}wisdom: ``Let it ^{F}be.'' ^{C\,Dmi7\,C}

\ssloka{\textbf{R_{1}}:}
	Let it ^{Ami}be let it ^{G}be let it ^{F}be let it ^{C}be,

	^{C\,\,\,\,}Whisper words of ^{G\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,}wisdom: ``Let it ^{F}be.'' ^{C\,Dmi7\,C}

\sloka
	And when the broken hearted people
   	
   	Living in the world agree
	
	There will be an answer, let it be.
   	
   	For though they may be parted
   	
   	There is still a chance that they will see
  	
  	There will be an answer,let it be.

\ssloka{\textbf{R_{2}}:}
	Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
    
    There will be an answer, let it be.

	And when the night is cloudy
   	
   	There is still a light that shines on me.
	
	Shine until the morrow, let it be.
   	
   	I wake up to the sound of music,
   	
   	Mother Mary comes to me
   	
   	Speaking words of wisdom: ``Let it be.''
