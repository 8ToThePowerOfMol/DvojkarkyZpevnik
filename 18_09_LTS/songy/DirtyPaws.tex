    ^{Ami \z}Jumping up and down the ^{C \z}floor,

    My head is an ^{\z Fmaj7}animal.~~~

    And ^{Ami \z}once there was an ^{\z C \,}animal,

    It had a son that mowed the ^{Fmaj7}lawn.

    The ^{Ami}son was an OK ^{C}guy,

    They had a pet ^{\z Fmaj7}dragonfly.~~~

    The ^{Ami \z}dragonfly, it ran ^{\z C \,}away,

    But it came back with a story to ^{Fmaj7}say.~

    Her dirty paws and furry coat,

    She ran down the forest slopes.

    The forest of talking trees,

    They used to sing about the birds and the bees.

    The bees had declared a war,

    The sky wasn't big enough for them all.

    The birds, they got help from below,

    From dirty paws and the creatures of snow.

    So for a while things were cold,

    They were scared down in their holes.

    The forest that once was green

    Was colored black by those killing machines.

    But she and her furry friends

    Took down the queen bee and her men.

    And that's how the story goes,

    The story of the beast with those four dirty paws.
