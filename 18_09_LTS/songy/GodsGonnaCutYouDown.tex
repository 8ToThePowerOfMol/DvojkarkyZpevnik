\sloka
You can ^{Ami}run on for a long time,
 
/: Run on for a long time, :/ 

/: ^{Ami/C}Sooner or ^{Ami}later, God'll ^{Ami/G}cut you ^{Ami}down. :/ 

\sloka
Go and tell that long tongue liar, 

Go and tell that midnight rider, 

Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back biter, 

/: Tell'em that God's gonna cut'em down. :/ 

\sloka
Well, my goodness gracious, let me tell you the news.

My head's been wet with the midnight dew. 

I've been down on bended knee, 

talkin' to the man from Galiee. 

\sloka
He spoke to me in a voice so sweet 

I thought I heard the shuffle of angel's feet.  

He called my name and my heart stood still 

When He ^{Mute}said \uv{John, go do my will!}

\sloka = 2.

\sloka = 1.

\sloka
You may throw your rock, hide your hand, 

Workin' in the dark against your fellow man. 

But as sure as God made black and white, 

What's done in the dark, will be brought to the light. 

\sloka = 1.

\sloka
Go and tell that long tongue liar, 

Go and tell that midnight rider, 

Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back biter, 

/: Tell'em that God's gonna  cut'em down. :/ 

Tell'em that God's gonna  cut'em down.
