	I ^{C}hurt ^{D(2sus)}myself ^{Ami}today to ^{C}see ^{\:D(2sus)}if~I~still ^{Ami}feel,

	^{\phantom{.}}I focus on the pain, the only thing that's real.

   	^{\phantom{.}}The needle tears a hole, the old familiar sting,

	Try to ^{C}kill it ^{D(2sus)}all ^{Ami}away, but ^{C}I ^{\:\:D(2sus)}remember ^{G}everything.


\refren
	^{Ami}What have I ^{\,\,\,\,Fmaj7}become, ^{C}my sweetest ^{G{\color{white}\_\_}}friend?

	^{\phantom{.}}Everyone I know goes away in the end.

	^{Ami\:\:\:}And~you~could have ^{\z Fmaj7G\:}it~all,~my empire of dirt,

	^{\phantom{.}}I will let you down, I will make you hurt.

\sloka
	 I wear this crown of thorns upon my liar's chair,

   	Full of broken thoughts I cannot repair.

   	Beneath the stains of time the feeling disappears,

   	You are someone else, I am still right here.


\refren\\\\

	^{Ami\z}If~I~could start ^{Fmaj7}again, a ^{G\,\,\,\,\,\,\,}million miles away,

	^{Ami\z}I~would keep ^{\,\,\,\,Fmaj7\z \,G}myself,~I would find a ^{Ami}way.
