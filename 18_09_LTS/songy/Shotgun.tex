\sloka
    ^{F \z}Home grown alligator, ^{B}see you later

    Gotta hit the ^{Dmi \z}road, gotta hit the ^{C \,}road.

    ^{F \z}Something changed in the atmosphere

    ^{B \z}Architecture unfamiliar ^{Dmi \z}I~could get used to this. ^{C}


\refren[1]
    ^{F \z}Time flies by in the ^{B \z}yellow and green,

    Stick ^{Dmi \z}around and you'll see what I ^{C \,}mean.

    There's a ^{F \z}mountain top that ^{B \z}I'm dreaming of,

    If you ^{Dmi}need me you know where ^{C \z}I'll be.


\refren[2]
    /: I'll be riding ^{F \z}shotgun underneath the ^{B}hot sun

    feeling like a ^{Dmi \z}someone. ^{C} :/


\sloka
    The ^{F \z}South of the Equator, ^{B \z}navigator,

    Gotta hit the ^{Dmi}road, gotta hit the ^{C \z}road.

    ^{F \z}Deep sea diving round the clock, ^{B \z}bikini bottoms, lager tops,

    ^{Dmi \z}I~could get used to this. ^{C}

\sloka
    We got ^{F}two in the front, ^{B}two in the back

    ^{Dmi \z}Sailing along and we ^{C \,\,}don't look back. ^{\,\, F B Dmi C}
