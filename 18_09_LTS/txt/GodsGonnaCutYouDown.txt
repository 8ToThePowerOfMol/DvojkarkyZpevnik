1. You can run on for a long time,
   /: Run on for a long time, :/
      Ami/C      Ami         Ami/G     Ami
   /: Sooner or later, God’ll cut you down. :/

2. Go and tell that long tongue liar,
   Go and tell that midnight rider,
   Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back biter,
   /: Tell’em that God’s gonna cut’em down. :/

3. Well, my goodness gracious, let me tell you the news.
   My head’s been wet with the midnight dew.
   I’ve been down on bended knee,
   talkin’ to the man from Galiee.

4. He spoke to me in a voice so sweet
   I thought I heard the shuffle of angel’s feet.
   He called my name and my heart stood still
             Mute
   When He said „John, go do my will!“

5. = 2.

6. = 1.

7. You may throw your rock, hide your hand,
   Workin’ in the dark against your fellow man.
   But as sure as God made black and white,
   What’s done in the dark, will be brought to the light.

8. = 1.

9. Go and tell that long tongue liar,
   Go and tell that midnight rider,
   Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back biter,
   /: Tell’em that God’s gonna cut’em down. :/
   Tell’em that God’s gonna cut’em down.
