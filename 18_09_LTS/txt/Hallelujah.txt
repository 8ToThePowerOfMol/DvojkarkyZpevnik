                                   Hallelujah

1. I heard there was a secret chord         4. Baby, I have been here before,
           C_                    Ami           I know this room, I’ve walked this floor,
   That David played and it pleased the        I used to live alone before I knew you.
   lord                                        I’ve seen your flag on the marble arch,
          F                G              C    but love is not a victory march,
   But you don’t really care for music, do     it’s cold and it’s a broken Hallelujah!
         G
   you?                                     R:
          C                     F__
   Well it goes like this: the fourth, the  5. There was a time you let me know,
     G                                         what’s really going on below,
   fifth,                                      but now you never show it to me, do you?
          Ami                F__               But I remember, when I moved in you,
   The minor fall and the major lift,          and the holy dove was moving too,
          G__            E 7
                                       Ami     and every breath we drew was Hallelujah!
   The baffled king composing Hallelujah!
                                            R:
         F        Ami           F
R: Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah,      6. Maybe there’s a God above,
        C           G           C              but all I’ve ever learned from love
   halleluuu - u - uuu - u - jah . . .         was how to shoot at someone who
                                               outdrew you.
2. Your faith was strong, but you needed       But it’s not a cry that you hear at night,
   proof,                                      it’s not somebody who’s seen the light,
   you saw her bathing on the roof,            it’s a cold and it’s a broken Hallelujah!
   her beauty and the moonlight
   overthrew you.                           7. I did my best, it wasn’t much,
   She tied you to a kitchen chair,            I couldn’t feel, so I tried to touch,
   she broke your throne, and she cut your     I’ve told the truth, I didn’t come to fool
   hair,                                       you.
   and from your lips she drew the             And even though it all went wrong,
   Hallelujah!                                 I’ll stand before the Lord of Song
                                               with nothing on my tongue but
R:                                             Hallelujah!

3. You say I took the name in vain,             R:
   I do not even know the name,
   but if I did, well really, what’s it to you?
   There’s a blaze of light in every word,
   it doesn’t matter which you heard,
   the holy or the broken Hallelujah!

R:
