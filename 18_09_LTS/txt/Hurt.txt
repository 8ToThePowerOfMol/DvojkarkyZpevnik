1. I hurt myself today to see if I still feel,

     I focus on the pain, the only thing that’s real.

     The needle tears a hole, the old familiar sting,
            C D(2sus) Ami           C D(2sus)         G
     Try to kill it all away, but I remember everything.

R: What have I become, my sweetest friend?

     Everyone I know goes away in the end.
         Ami              Fmaj7 G
     And you could have it all, my empire of dirt,

     I will let you down, I will make you hurt.

2. I wear this crown of thorns upon my liar’s chair,
   Full of broken thoughts I cannot repair.
   Beneath the stains of time the feeling disappears,
   You are someone else, I am still right here.

     If I could start again, a million miles away,
     Ami              Fmaj7 G                Ami
     I would keep myself, I would find a way.
