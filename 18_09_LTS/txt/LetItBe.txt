 1. When I find myself in times of trouble
    Ami           Fmaj7
    Mother Mary comes to me
     C                  G                F C Dmi7 C
    Speaking words of wisdom: “Let it be.”
     C                   G
    And in my hour of darkness
            Ami              Fmaj7
    She is standing right in front of me
     C                  G                F C Dmi7 C
    Speaking words of wisdom: “Let it be.”
           Ami        G         F          C
R1 : Let it be let it be let it be let it be,
       C                G                  F C Dmi7 C
     Whisper words of wisdom: “Let it be.”

 2. And when the broken hearted people
    Living in the world agree
    There will be an answer, let it be.
    For though they may be parted
    There is still a chance that they will see
    There will be an answer,let it be.

R2 : Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
     There will be an answer, let it be.

 3. And when the night is cloudy
    There is still a light that shines on me.
    Shine until the morrow, let it be.
    I wake up to the sound of music,
    Mother Mary comes to me
    Speaking words of wisdom: “Let it be.”
