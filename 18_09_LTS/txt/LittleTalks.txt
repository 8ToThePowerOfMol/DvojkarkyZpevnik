 1. I don’t like walking around this old and empty house             R2 : 2×
        Ami                 F                  C
    So hold my hand, I’ll walk with you, my dear.                    R1 : 2×
          Ami          F                 C
    The stairs creak as you sleep, it’s keeping me awake
              Ami          F                 C
    It’s the house telling you to close your eyes
          Ami         F             C
    And some days I can’t even dress myself
         Ami           F             C
    It’s killing me to see you this way.
                          Ami        F
R1 : ’Cause though the truth may vary
                                                                   (4×)

     this ship will carry our bodies safe to shore. (. . . Hey!)

 2. There’s an old voice in my head that’s holding me back.
    Well tell her that I miss our little talks
    Soon it will be over and buried with our past.
    We used to play outside when we were young (and full of life and full of love).
    Some days I don’t know if I am wrong or right
    Your mind is playing tricks on you, my dear.

R2 : Don’t listen to a word I say. Hey!
          Ami          F         C        G
     The screams all sound the same. Hey!
                   Ami        F
     Though the truth may vary
                                                                   (4×)

     this ship will carry our bodies safe to shore. (. . . Hey!)

 3. You’re gone, gone, gone away I watched you disappear.
    All that’s left is a ghost of you.
    Now we’re torn, torn, torn apart, there’s nothing we can do
    Just let me go we’ll meet again soon.
    Now wait, wait, wait for me please hang around.
    I’ll see you when I fall asleep. Hey!
