                                         Hallelujah
                             Leonard Cohen / Jeff Buckley


       C                 Am
1. I heard there was a secret chord               R:
         C                    Am
 That David played and it pleased the lord        5. There was a time you let me know,
       F                 G              C     G     what’s really going on below,
 But you don’t really care for music, do you?       but now you never show it to me, do you?
       C                       F          G         But I remember, when I moved in you,
 Well it goes like this the fourth, the fifth       and the holy dove was moving too,
       Am                   F                       and every breath we drew was Hallelujah!
 The minor fall and the major lift
        G              E7           Am            R:
 The baffled king composing hallelujah
                                                  6. Maybe there’s a God above,
        F         Am            F                   but all I’ve ever learned from love
R: Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah,              was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you.
     C            G         C                       But it’s not a cry that you hear at night,
 halleluuu - u - uuu - u - jah . . .                it’s not somebody who’s seen the light,
                                                    it’s a cold and it’s a broken Hallelujah!
2. Your faith was strong, but you needed proof,
 you saw her bathing on the roof,                 7. I did my best, it wasn’t much,
 her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you.        I couldn’t feel, so I tried to touch,
 She tied you to a kitchen chair,                   I’ve told the truth, I didn’t come to fool you.
 she broke your throne, and she cut your hair,      And even though it all went wrong,
 and from your lips she drew the Hallelujah!        I’ll stand before the Lord of Song
                                                    with nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah!
R:
                                                  R:
3. You say I took the name in vain,
 I don’t even know the name,
 but if I did, well really, what’s it to you?
 There’s a blaze of light in every word,
 it doesn’t matter which you heard,
 the holy or the broken Hallelujah!

R:

4. Baby, I’ve been here before,
 I know this room, I’ve walked this floor,
 I used to live alone before I knew you.
 I’ve seen your flag on the marble arch,
 but love is not a victory march,
 it’s a cold and it’s a broken Hallelujah!
