1. I’m sittin’ here in the boring room         4. I’m sittin’ here I miss the power
  Emi                                Hmi         I’d like to go out, takin’ a shower
  It’s just another rainy Sunday afternoon       But there’s a heavy cloud inside my head
  Emi                           Hmi              I feel so tired put myself into bed
  I’m wasting my time I got nothing to do        Where nothing ever happens
  Emi                        Hmi                 And I wonder
  I’m hangin’ aroud I got waitin’ for you
                                                      H    Emi
  Ami                        H
                                               5. Isolation is not good for me
  But nothing ever happens
                                                     D     G              H
          Emi
                                                 Isolation I don’t want to sit on a lemon
  And I wonder
                                              tree
2. I’m drivin’ aroud in my car
                                               6. I’m steppin’ around in a desert of joy
  I’m drivin’ too fast, I’m drivin’ too far
                                                 Baby anyhow I get another toy
  I’d like to change my point of view
                                                 And everything will happen
  I feel so lonely I’m waiting for you
                                                 And you’ll wonder
  But nothing ever happen
                                                 G
   G                  D
                                              R: I wonder how...
R: I wonder how, wonder why
     Emi                             Hmi
  Yesterday you told me ’bout the blue           G
  blue sky                                    R: I wonder how...
    C                 D
  And all that I can see                        . . . and all that I can see –
                     G        D                 and all that I can see –
  Is just a yellow lemon tree                   and all that I can see
   G                    D                       Is just a yellow lemon tree
  I’m turnin’ my head up and down
  Emi                              Hmi
   I’m turnin’, turnin’, turnin’, turnin’,
  turnin’ around
    C                 D
  And all that I can see
                     G        D
  Is just a yellow lemon tree
