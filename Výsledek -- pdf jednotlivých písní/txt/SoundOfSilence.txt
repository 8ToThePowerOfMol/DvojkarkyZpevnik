     Sound Of Silence
       Simon & Garfunkel

   Ami                   G
1. Hello darkness my old friend
                                 Ami
   I’ve come to talk with you again
                 C            FC
   because a vision softly creeping
                                FC
   left it seeds while I was sleeping.
                F                             C
   And the vision that was planted in my brain
           Ami     C           G       Ami
   still remains within the sound of silence.

2. In restless dreams I walked alone,
   narrow streets of cobble-stone ,
   ’neath the halo of a street lamp
   I turned my collar to the cold and damp.
   When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
   that spilt the night and touched the sound of silence.

3. And in the naked light I saw
   ten thousand people maybe more
   People talking without speaking,
   people hearing without listening,
   people writing songs that voices never share,
   and no one dare disturb the sound of silence.

4. „Fools!“ said I „you do not know
   silence like a cancer grows
   hear my words that I might teach you
   take my arms that I might reach you.“
   But my words like silent raindrops fell
   and echoed in the wells of silence.

5. And the people bowed and prayed
   to the neon god they made
   and the sign flashed out its warning
   in the words that it was forming and the sign said:
   „The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls
   and tenament halls“ and whisper’d in the sound of silence.
