  Don’t know what for
                   E          A         B
  You’re turning heads when you walk through the door
  Don’t need make up
  To cover up
  Being the way that you are is enough

   The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
   But you when smile at the ground it ain’t hard to tell
