You can ^{Ami}run on for a long time,
 
/: Run on for a long time, :/ 

/: ^{Ami/C}Sooner, or ^{Ami}later, God'll ^{Ami/G}cut you ^{Ami}down. :/ 

\sloka
Go and tell that long tongue liar, 

Go and tell that midnight rider, 

Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back biter, 

/: ^{Ami/C}Tell'em that ^{Ami}God's gonna  ^{Ami/G}cut'em ^{Ami}down. :/ 

\sloka
Well my goodness gracious, let me tell you the news.

My heads been wet with the midnight dew. 

I've been down on bended knee, 

talkin to the man from Galiee. 

\sloka
He spoketo me in a voice so sweet, 

I thought I heard the shuffle of angels feet.  

He called my name and my heart stood still,  

When He ^{Mute}said \uv{John go do my will}  

\sloka 
Go and ^{Ami}tell that long tongue liar, 

Go and tell that midnight rider, 

Tell the rambiler, the gambler, the back biter, 

/: Tell'em that God's gonna  cut'em down. :/ 

\sloka
You can run on for a long time, 

/: Run on for a long time, :/  

/: Sooner, or later, God'll cut you down. :/ 

\sloka
You may throw your rock, hide your hand, 

Workin in the dark against your fellow man. 

But as sure as God made black and white, 

What's done in the dark, will be brought to the light. 

\sloka
You can run on for a long time, 

/: Run on for a long time, :/ 

/: Sooner, or later, God'll cut you down. :/ 

\sloka
Go and tell that long tongue liar, 

Go and tell that midnight rider, 

/: Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back biter, :/ 

/: Tell'em that God's gonna  cut'em down. :/
