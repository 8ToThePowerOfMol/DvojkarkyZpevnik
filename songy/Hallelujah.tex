\begin{verse}[numbered]
	I ^{C}heard there was a ^{Am}secret chord  \\
	That ^{C}David ^{Am}played and it pleased the lord  \\
	But^{F} you don't really ^{G}care for music, ^{C}do you?  ^{G}  \\
	Well it ^{C}goes like this the ^{F}fourth, the ^{G}fifth  \\
	The ^{Am}minor fall and the ^{F}major lift  \\
	The ^{G}baffled king ^{E7}composing halle^{Am}lujah  \\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse*}
\hspace*{-0.45cm}\textbf{R:}Halle ^{F}lujah, hallel ^{Am} ujah, halle ^{F} lujah, hal ^{C} lelu-u- ^{G} u-u- ^{C} jah ....

\begin{verse}[numbered]
	Your faith was strong, but you needed proof,  \\
	you saw her bathing on the roof,  \\
	her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you.  \\
	She tied you to a kitchen chair,  \\
	she broke your throne, and she cut your hair,  \\
	and from your lips she drew the Hallelujah!  \\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}[numbered]	
	You say I took the name in vain,  \\
	I don't even know the name,  \\
	but if I did, well really, what's it to you?  \\
	There's a blaze of light in every word,  \\
	it doesn't matter which you heard,  \\
	the holy or the broken Hallelujah!  \\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}[numbered]	
	Baby, I've been here before,  \\
	I know this room, I've walked this floor,  \\
	I used to live alone before I knew you.  \\

\begin{verse*}
	I've seen your flag on the marble arch,  \\
	but love is not a victory march,  \\
	it's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah!  \\

\begin{verse}
\item[5.]There was a time you let me know,   \\
	what's really going on below,   \\
	but now you never show it to me, do you?   \\
	But I remember, when I moved in you,   \\
	and the holy dove was moving too,   \\
	and every breath we drew was Hallelujah!   \\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
\item[6.]Maybe there's a God above,   \\
	but all I've ever learned from love   \\
	was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you.   \\
	But it's not a cry that you hear at night,   \\
	it's not somebody who's seen the light,   \\
	it's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah!   \\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
\item[7.]I did my best, it wasn't much,   \\
	I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch,   \\
	I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you.   \\
	And even though it all went wrong,   \\
	I'll stand before the Lord of Song   \\
	with nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah!   \\
