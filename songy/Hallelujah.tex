	I ^{C}heard there was a ^{Am}secret chord  
	
	That ^{C}David played and it ^{Am}pleased the lord  
	
	But ^{F}you don't really ^{G}care for music, ^{C}do you?^{G}  
	
	Well ^{C}it goes like this the ^{F}fourth, the ^{G}fifth  
	
	The ^{Am}minor fall and the ^{F}major lift

	Your faith was strong, but you needed proof,  
	
	you saw her bathing on the roof,  
	
	her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you.  
	
	She tied you to a kitchen chair,  
	
	she broke your throne, and she cut your hair,  
	
	and from your lips she drew the Hallelujah!

\sloka
	You say I took the name in vain,  
	
	I don't even know the name,  
	
	but if I did, well really, what's it to you?  
	
	There's a blaze of light in every word,  

	it doesn't matter which you heard,  
	
	the holy or the broken Hallelujah!

\sloka
	Baby, I've been here before,  
	
	I know this room, I've walked this floor,  
	
	I used to live alone before I knew you.  
	
	I've seen your flag on the marble arch,  
	
	but love is not a victory march,  
	
	it's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah!

	There was a time you let me know,   
	
	what's really going on below,   
	
	but now you never show it to me, do you?   
	
	But I remember, when I moved in you,   
	
	and the holy dove was moving too,   
	
	and every breath we drew was Hallelujah!

\sloka
	Maybe there's a God above,   
	
	but all I've ever learned from love   
	
	was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you.   
	
	But it's not a cry that you hear at night,   
	
	it's not somebody who's seen the light,   
	
	it's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah!   
	
\sloka
	I did my best, it wasn't much,   
	
	I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch,   
	
	I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you.   
	
	And even though it all went wrong,   
	
	I'll stand before the Lord of Song   
	
	with nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah!
