	He said, \uv{ ^{Em}Son,

	Have you seen the ^{H}world?

	Well, what would you ^{A}say
                   
	If I said that you ^{Emi}could?
               
	Just carry this ^{A}gun 
                   
	and you’ll even get ^{Emi}paid.}
                            
	I said, \uv{That sounds pretty ^{H}good.}
              
	Black leather ^{Emi}boots
              
	Spit-shined so ^{H}bright
                
	They cut off my ^{A}hair 
             
	but it looked ^{Emi}alright
                 
	We marched and we ^{A}sang
              
	We all became ^{Emi}friends
                     
	As we learned how to ^{H}fight


\refren
	A hero of ^{F\# mi}war

	Yeah that’s what I’ll ^{A}be
               
	And when I come ^{Emi}home
                        
	They’ll be damn proud of ^{H}me
               
	I’ll carry this ^{F\# mi}flag
                 
	To the grave if I ^{A}must
                        
	Because it’s flag that I ^{Emi}love
                  
	And a flag that I ^{H}trust


\sloka
	I kicked in the ^{Emi}door
             
	I yelled my ^{H}commands
                   
	The children, they ^{A}cried
              
	But I got my ^{Emi}man
            
	We took him ^{A}away
                
	A bag over his ^{Emi}face
                       
	From his family and his ^{H}friends

	They took off his ^{Emi}clothes
                 
	They pissed in ^{H}his hands
                
	I told them to ^{A}stop
              
	But then I ^{Emi}joined in
                 
	We beat him with ^{A}guns
                  
	And batons not just ^{Emi}once
               
	But again and ^{H}again

\sloka
	She ^{Emi}walked 
                    
	through bullets and ^{H}haze
                
	I asked her to ^{A}stop
               
	I begged her to ^{Emi}stay
               
	But she pressed ^{A}on
                
	So I lifted my ^{Emi}gun
             
	And I fired ^{H}away
    
	The ^{Emi}shells 
                    
	jumped through the ^{H}smoke
             
	And into the ^{A}sand
                        
	That the blood now had ^{Emi}soaked
        
	She ^{A}collapsed 
                   
	with a flag in her ^{Emi}hand
                
	A flag white as ^{H}snow


\sloka
	A hero of ^{F\# mi}war
                 
	Is that what the ^{A}see
                
	Just medals and ^{E}scars
                
	So damn proud of ^{H}me
                        
	And I brought home that ^{F\# mi}flag
               
	Now it gathers ^{A}dust
                        
	But it’s a flag that I ^{E}love
                       
	It’s the only flag I ^{H}trust


\refren
He said, \uv{ ^{Emi}Son, 
                   
have you seen the ^{H}world? 
                    
Well what would you ^{A}say, 
                   
if I said that you ^{Emi}could?}
