\sloka 
	I ^{C}hurt ^{D}myself ^{Ami}today to ^{C}see ^{D}if I still ^{Ami}feel,

	I focus on the pain, the only thing that's real.
   	
   	The needle tears a hole, the old familiar sting,

	try to ^{C}kill it ^{D}all ^{Ami}away, but I ^{C}remember ^{D\,\,\,\,\,G}everything.


\refren
	What have I ^{F}become, ^{C}my sweetest ^{G}friend?
	
	Everyone I know goes away in the end.

	And ^{Ami}you could have it ^{F}all, ^{G}my empire of dirt,
	
	I will let you down, I will make you hurt.

\sloka   
	 wear this crown of thorns upon my liar's chair,
   	
   	full of broken thoughts I cannot repair.
   	
   	Beneath the stains of time the feeling disappears,
   	
   	you are someone else, I am still right here.


\refren
   
   
\sloka
	^{Ami}If I could start again, ^{F}a million ^{G}miles away,

	^{Ami}I would keep myself, I ^{F}would ^{G}find ^{Ami}a way.
