\sloka 
	I ^{C}hurt ^{D2}myself ^{Ami}today to ^{C}see if ^{D2}I still ^{Ami}feel,

	^{\phantom{.}}I focus on the pain, the only thing that's real.
   	
   	^{\phantom{.}}The needle tears a hole, the old familiar sting,

	try to ^{C}kill it ^{D2}all ^{Ami}away, but ^{C}I ^{D2}remember ^{G}everything.


\refren
	^{Ami}What have I ^{\,\,\,\,Fmaj7}become, ^{C}my sweetest ^{G{\color{white}\_\_}}friend?
	
	^{\phantom{.}}Everyone I know goes away in the end.

	And ^{Ami}you could have it ^{Fmaj7}all, ^{G}my empire of dirt,
	
	^{\phantom{.}}I will let you down, I will make you hurt.

\sloka   
	 I wear this crown of thorns upon my liar's chair,
   	
   	full of broken thoughts I cannot repair.
   	
   	Beneath the stains of time the feeling disappears,
   	
   	you are someone else, I am still right here.


\refren\\
   
	^{Ami}If I could start ^{Fmaj7}again, a ^{G\,\,\,\,\,\,\,}million miles away,

	^{Ami}I would keep ^{\,\,\,\,Fmaj7}myself, ^{G}I would find a ^{Ami}way.
