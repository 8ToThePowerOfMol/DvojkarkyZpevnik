All my ^{C}bags are packed I'm ^{F}ready to go

I'm ^{C}standing here ^{F}outside your door

I ^{C}hate to wake you ^{F}up to say ^{G7}goodbye

But the dawn is breaking it's early morn

The taxi's waitin' he's blownin' his horn

Already I'm so lonesome I could die

\refren
So ^{C}kiss me and ^{F}smile for me

^{C}Tell me that you'll ^{F}wait for me

^{C}Hold me like you'll ^{F}never let me ^{G7}go

Cause ^{C}I'm leavin' ^{F}on a jet plane

^{C}Don't know when ^{F}I'll be back again

^{C}Oh, ^{F}babe I hate to ^{G7}go

\sloka
There's is many times I've let you down

So many time I've played around

I tell you now they don't mean a thing 

Every place I go I'll think of you 

Every song I sing I'll ^{F}sing for you 

When I come back I'll ^{F}bring your wedding ring

\refren

\sloka
Now the time come to leave you 

One more time let me kiss you 

Then close your eyes I'll be on my way 

Dream about the days to come 

When I won't have to leave alone 

About the times I won't have to say 

\refren
