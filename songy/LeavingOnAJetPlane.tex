\begin{verse}[numbered]
All my bags^{C} are packed I'm ready^{F} to go\\
I'm standing^{C} here outside^{F} your door\\
I hate^{C} to wake you up^{F} to say goodbye^{G7} \\
But the dawn^{C} is breaking it's early^{F} morn\\
The taxi's^{C} waitin' he's blownin'^{F} his horn\\
Already^{C} I'm so lonesome^{F} I could die^{G7}\\
\end{verse}
\begin{verse*}
\hspace*{-0.45cm}\textbf{R:}So kiss^{C} me and smile^{F} for me\\
Tell^{C} me that you'll wait^{F} for me\\
Hold^{C} me like you'll never^{F} let me go^{G7} \\
Cause I'm^{C} leavin' on^{F} a jet plane\\
Don't^{C} know when I'll^{F} be back again\\
Oh,^{C} babe^{F}  I hate to go^{G7}\\
\end{verse*}
\begin{verse}[numbered]
There's is many times I've let you down\\
So many time I've played around\\
I tell you now they don't mean a thing \\
Every place I go I'll think of you \\
Every song I sing I'll sing^{F} for you \\
When I come back I'll bring^{F} your wedding ring\\
\end{verse}

\item[3.]Now the time come to leave you \\
One more time let me kiss you \\ 
Then close your eyes I'll be on my way \\
Dream about the days to come \\
When I won't have to leave alone \\
About the times I won't have to say \\
