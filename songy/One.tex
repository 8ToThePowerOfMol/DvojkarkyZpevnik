\sloka 
 	^{Ami}Is it getting ^{D{\color{white}\_\_\_}}better

	^{F\,}Or do you feel the ^{G{\color{white}\_\_\_}}same?

	^{Ami}Will it make it ^{D{\color{white}\_\_\_}}easier on you now

	^{F\,\,}If you've got someone to ^{{\color{white}\_\_\_}G}blame?

   
\refren
	You said ^{C}one love ^{Ami}

	One life ^{F}

	When it's one need ^{C}
         
	In the night.
  
	One love, we get to ^{Ami\,\,}share it.

	It ^{F{\color{white}\_\_}}leaves you, baby, if you don't ^{C{\color{white}\_\_}}care for it.   


\sloka
	Did I disappoint you

	Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?

	You act like you never had love

	And you want me to go without.


\refren
	Well it's too late 

	Tonight 

	To drag the past out 

	Into the light.

	We're one but we're not the same.

	We get to carry each other,

	Carry each other.
 
	One.

\sloka    
	Have you come here for forgiveness?

	Have you come to raise the dead?

	Have you come here to play Jesus

	To the lepers in your head?

\refren       
	Did I ask too much? 

	More than a lot?

	You gave me nothing, now
	   
	It's all I got.

	We're one but we're not the same.

	Well, we hurt each other and we do it again. 
 
\refren
	You said ^{C{\color{white}\_}}love is a temple.

	^{Ami\,\,}Love the higher law.

	Love is a temple.	

	Love the higher law.

	^{C{\color{white}\_}}You ask me to enter

	^{G\,\,}But then you make me crawl

	I can't be holding on ^{F}
                  
	To what you've got

	When all you've got is ^{C}hurt.
  
\refren
	One love, ^{Ami}

	One blood, ^{F}

	One life, ^{C}
 
	You've got to do what you should.

	One life with ^{Ami\,\,}each other. ^{F}
 
 	Sisters, ^{C}
 
	Brothers.
   
	One life, but we're ^{Ami}not the same.

	We get to ^{F}carry each other,

  	^{C{\color{white}\_\_}}Carry each other,

  	/: ^{C\,\,Ami\,\,}One ^{F\,\,C\,\,}One. :/
