	^{Ami}Just a ^{D{\color{white}\_\_\_}}perfect day, 

	^{G{\color{white}\_\_}}Drink Sangria ^{C}in the park, 

	And ^{F{\color{white}\_\_}}later, when ^{Dmi}it gets dark, 

	We go ^{E{\color{white}\_\_}}home.

\sloka
	Just a perfect day, 

	Feed animals in the zoo 

	Then later, a movie, too, 

	And then home.

	Oh ^{A\,}it's such a ^{D{\color{white}\_\_\_}}perfect day, 

	^{C\#mi}I'm glad I spent it with ^{D\,\,\,\,\,}you.

	^{A\,}Oh such a ^{E\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,}perfect day, 

	You just ^{F\#mi}keep me ^{E\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,}hanging ^{D\,\,\,}on, 

	You just ^{F\#mi}keep me ^{E\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,}hanging ^{D\,\,\,}on. 
 
\sloka 
	Just a perfect day, 

	Problems all left alone, 

	Weekenders on our own. 

	It's such fun. 

\sloka
	Just a perfect day, 

	You made me forget myself. 
	
	I thought I was someone else, 
	
	Someone good.
