\begin{song}{title=Do Ameriky}

\begin{verse}[numbered]
^{Ami}Hello darkness my ^{G}old friend \\
   I've come to talk with you ^{Ami}again \\
   because a ^{C}vision softly ^{F  C}creeping \\
   left it seeds while I was ^{F  C}sleeping \\
   and the ^{F}vision that was planted in my ^{C}brain \\
   still remains ^{Ami} ^{C}within the ^{G}sound of ^{Ami}silence \\
\end{verse}
\begin{verse}[numbered]
In restless dreams I walked alone \\
   narrow streets of cobble-stone \\
   neath the halo of a street lamp \\
   I turned my collar to the cold and damp \\
   when my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light \\
   that spilt the night and touched the sound of silence \\
\end{verse}
\begin{verse}[numbered]
And in the naked light I saw \\
   ten thousand people maybe more \\
   people talking without speaking \\
   people hearing without listening \\
   people writing songs that voices never share \\
   and no one dare disturb the sound of silence \\
\end{verse}
\begin{verse}[numbered]
\uv{Fools!} said I \uv{you do not know \\
   silence like a cancer grows \\
   hear my words that I might teach you \\
   take my armsthat I might reach you.} \\
   But my words like silent raindrops fell \\
   and echoed in the wells of silence. \\
\end{verse}
\begin{verse}[numbered]
And the people bowed and prayed \\
   to the neon god they made \\
   and the sign flashed out its warning \\
   in the words that it was forming and the sign said: \\
   \uv{The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls \\
   and tenament halls} and whisper'd in the sound of silence. \\
\end{verse}
