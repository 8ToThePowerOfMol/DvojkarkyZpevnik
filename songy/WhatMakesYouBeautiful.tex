You're ^{E}insecure ^{A} 

Don't know what ^{B}for 

You're turning ^{E}heads when ^{A}you walk ^{B}through the door 

Don't need make up 

To cover up 

Being the way that you are is enough 

\sloka
^{E}Everyone ^{A}else in ^{B}the room can see it 

^{E}Everyone ^{A}else but you 

\sloka
Baby you ^{E}light up ^{A}my world ^{B}like nobody else 

The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed 

But you when smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell 

\sloka
You don't ^{E A}know

You don't know you're beautiful 

If only you saw what I can see 

You'll understand why I want you so desperately 

Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe 

You don't know

You don't know you're ^{E} beautiful^{A}  

But ^{B}that's what makes you beautiful 

\sloka
So c-come on 

You got it wrong

To prove I'm right I put it in a song  

I don't why

You're being shy

And turn away when I look into your eyes 

\sloka
Everyone else in the room can see it  

Everyone else but you
