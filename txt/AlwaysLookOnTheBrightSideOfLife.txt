 1. Some things in life are bad, they can really make you mad.
          Ami                    D          G
    Other things just make you swear and curse.
                  Ami               D              G             Emi
    When you’re chewing on life’s gristle, don’t grumble, give a whistle.
        Ami                                  D7
    And this’ll help things turn out for the best.

 R: And always look on the bright side of life.
    Always look on the light side of life.
       Ami              D               G                Emi
 2. If life seems jolly rotten, there’s something you’ve forgotten.
                    Ami                   D         G
    And that’s to laugh and smile and dance and sing.
                    Ami           D                G Emi
    When you’ve feeling in the dumps, don’t be silly chumps.
           Ami                                     D7
    Just purse your lips and whistle – that’s the thing.

 R: And always look on the bright side of life.
    Come on, always look on the bright side of life.

 3. For life is quite absurd and death’s the final word,
    You must always face the curtain with a bow.
    Forget about your sin – give the audience a grin.
    Enjoy it – it’s your last chance anyhow.

 R: So always look on the bright side of death
    Just before you draw your terminal breath.

 4. Life’s a piece of shit when you look at it.
    Life’s a laugh and death’s a joke, it’s true.
    You’ll see it’s all a show, keep’em laughing as you go.
    Just remember that the last laugh is on you.

 R: And always look on the bright side of life.
    Always look on the right side of life.
    (Come on guys, cheer up.)
