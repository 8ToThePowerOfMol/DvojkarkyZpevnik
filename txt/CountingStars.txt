 1. Lately, I’ve been, I’ve been losing sleep
    G                                  F
    Dreaming about the things that we could be.
        Ami                C
    But baby, I’ve been, I’ve been praying hard,
    G
    Said, no more counting dollars
    F                                F
    We’ll be counting stars, yeah we’ll be counting stars.

 2. I see this life like a swinging vine,
    C
    Swing my heart across the line.
    G
    In my face is flashing signs
      F
    Seek it out and ye shall find.
    Oh, but I’m not that old
    Young, but I’m not that bold
    I don’t think the world is sold
    I’m just doing what we’re told.

R1 : I feel something so right
                 F
     Doing the wrong thing.
     I feel something so wrong
     Doing the right thing.

     I could lie, could lie, could lie
     Everything that kills me makes me feel alive.

     3. I feel the love and I feel it burn
        Down this river, every turn
        Hope is a four-letter word
        Make that money, watch it burn
        Oh, but I’m not that old
