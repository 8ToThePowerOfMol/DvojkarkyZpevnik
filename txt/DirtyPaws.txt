 1. Jumping up and down the floor,
                       Fmaj7
    My head is an animal.
         Ami                     C
    And once there was an animal,
                                  Fmaj7
    It had a son that mowed the lawn.
         Ami                C
    The son was an OK guy,
                           Fmaj7
    They had a pet dragonfly.
         Ami                C
    The dragonfly, it ran away,
                                     Fmaj7
    But it came back with a story to say.

 2. Her dirty paws and furry coat,
    She ran down the forest slopes.
    The forest of talking trees,
    They used to sing about the birds and the bees.
    The bees had declared a war,
    The sky wasn’t big enough for them all.
    The birds, they got help from below,
    From dirty paws and the creatures of snow.

 3. So for a while things were cold,
    They were scared down in their holes.
    The forest that once was green
    Was colored black by those killing machines.
    But she and her furry friends
    Took down the queen bee and her men.
    And that’s how the story goes,
    The story of the beast with those four dirty paws.
