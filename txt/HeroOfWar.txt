             E                                3. I kicked in the door,
1. He said, Son,                                  I yelled my commands.
                         Gm                        The children, they cried
  Have you see the world?                          But I got my man.
                            A                      We took him away
  Well, what would you say                         A bag over his face
                             E                     From his family and his friends.

  Just carry this gun and you'll even get          They pissed in his hands.
     E                                             I told them to stop
  paid.                                           But then I joined in.
                                        B          We beat him with guns
  I said, That sounds pretty good.               And batons not just once
                                                   But again and again.
2. Black leather boots
  Spit-shined so bright                       R:
  They cut o my hair but it looked
  alright.                                    5. She walked through bullets and haze,
  We marched and we sang,                          I asked her to stop,
  We all became friends                            I begged her to stay,
  As we learned how to ght.                       But she pressed on.
                                                   So I lifted my gun
             Cm                                    And I red away.
R: A hero of war,

  Yeah that's what I'll be                    smoke
                         E                         And into the sand
  And when I come home                             That the blood now had soaked.
                                 B                 She collapsed with a ag in her hand
  They'll be damn proud of me.                     A ag white as snow.

                        A                          . . . And I brought home that ag,
  To the grave if I must                           Now it gathers dust

                                 E                 But it's a ag that I love

  Because it's ag that I love                     The only ag that I trust.
                                                   He said, Son, have you seen the
