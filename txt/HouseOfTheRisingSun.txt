House Of The Rising Sun
   Ami        C__ D_           F
1. There is a house in New Orleans
        Ami       C__ E
   They call the Rising Sun
            Ami     C       D           F
   And it’s been a ruin of many a poor boy
       Ami      E        Ami C D F Ami E Ami E
   And God I know I’m one.

2. My mother was a tailor
   Sewed my new blue jeans,
   My father was a gamblin’ man
   Down in New Orleans.

3. Now the only thing a gambler needs
   Is suitcase and trunk
   And the only time he’s satisfied
   Is when he’s on, a drunk.

4. Oh mother tell your children
   Not to do what I have done
   Spend your lives in sin and misery
   In the House of the Rising Sun.

5. Well, I’ve got one foot on the platform
   The other foot on the train
   I’m going back to New Orleans
   To wear that ball and chain.

6. = 1.
