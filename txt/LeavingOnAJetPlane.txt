1. All my bags are packed I’m ready to go.
       C___           F__
   I’m standing here outside your door.
      C                      F __G7
   I hate to wake you up to say goodbye,

     But the dawn is breaking it’s early morn.

     The taxi’s waitin’ he’s blownin’ his horn.

     Already I’m so lonesome I could die.

R: So kiss me and smile for me,
   C                     F
   Tell me that you’ll wait for me,
   C                      F          G7
   Hold me like you’ll never let me go.
           C          F
   Cause I’m leavin’ on a jet plane,
   C                   F
   Don’t know when I’ll be back again.
   C      F            G7
   Oh, babe I hate to go.

2. There’s so many times I’ve let you down,
   So many time I’ve played around.
   I tell you now they don’t mean a thing.
   Every place I go I’ll think of you,
   Every song I sing I’ll sing for you.
   When I come back I’ll bring your wedding ring.

R:

3. Now the time’s come to leave you.
   One more time let me kiss you.
   Close your eyes I’ll be on my way.
   Dream about the days to come
   When I won’t have to leave alone.
   About the times I won’t have to say:

R:
