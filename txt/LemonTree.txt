   It’s just another rainy Sunday               4. I’m sittin’ here, I miss the power,
       Hmi                                         I’d like to go out, takin’ a shower.
   afternoon.                                      But there’s a heavy cloud inside my
        Emi                      Hmi            head,
   I’m wasting my time I got nothing               I feel so tired put myself into bed
   to do,                                          Where nothing ever happens
        Emi                  Hmi                   And I wonder.
   I’m hangin’ aroud I got waitin’ for you.
        Ami                    H                   H         Emi
   But nothing ever happens                     5. Isolation is not good for me.
          Emi                                      D          G
   And I wonder.                                   Isolation, I don’t want to
                                                   H
2. I’m drivin’ aroud in my car,                    sit on a lemon tree.
   I’m drivin’ too fast, I’m drivin’ too far,
   I’d like to change my point of view,         6. I’m steppin’ around in a desert of joy,
   I feel so lonely I’m waiting for you.           Baby, anyhow I get another toy
   But nothing ever happens.                       And everything will happen
                                                   And you’ll wonder.
