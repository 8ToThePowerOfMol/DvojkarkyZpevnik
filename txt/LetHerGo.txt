R: Well you only need the light when its burning low
                  D                      Emi
   Only miss the sun when its starts to snow
                   C                         G
   Only know you love her when you let her go
                            C                        G
   Only know you’ve been high when youre feeling low
                  D                         Emi
   Only hate the road when youre missin’ home

1. Staring at the bottom of your glass
           D                             Hmi
   Hoping one day you will make a dream last.
                      Emi              C     Dsus4
   The dreams come slow and they go so fast
   You see her when you close your eyes
   Maybe one day you will understand why
   Everything you touch surely dies.
R: But you only need the light when it’s burning low
   Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
   Only know you love her when you’ve let her go
   Only know you’ve been high when you’re feeling low
   Only hate the road when you’re missin home
   Only know you love her when you’ve let her go.

R: Staring at the ceiling in the dark
   Same ol’ empty feeling in your heart.
   Love comes slow and it goes so fast
   Well you see her when you fall asleep
   But to never to touch and never to keep
   Because you loved her too much
   And you dive too deep.
                   Emi
R: And you let her go
          C         D
   Ooooo ooooo oooooo.
   And you let her go
   Ooooooo ooooo ooooo.
   And you let her go.
