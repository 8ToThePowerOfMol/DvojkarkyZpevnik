1. Just a perfect day,
   G             C
   Drink Sangria in the park
        F          Dmi
   And later when it gets dark
          E
   We go home.

2. Just a perfect day,
   Feed animals in the zoo
   Then later, a movie, too
   And then home.

   I’m glad I spent it with you.

   Oh such a perfect day,
            F 4mi      E       D
   You just keep me hanging on,
            F 4mi      E       D
   You just keep me hanging on.

3. Just a perfect day,
   Problems all left alone,
   Weekenders on our own.
   It’s such fun.

4. Just a perfect day,
   You made me forget myself.
   I thought I was someone else,
   Someone good.
