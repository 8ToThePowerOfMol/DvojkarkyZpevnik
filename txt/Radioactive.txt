 1. I’m waking up to ash and dust
               D                       Ami
    I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
                 C              G D
    I’m breathing in the chemicals.
    Ami            C           G                D
     I’m breaking in, shaping up, then checking out on the prison bus.
    Ami C                  G          D
    This is it, the apocalypse. . . . Whoa.

 2. I raise my flags, don my clothes
               D                  Ami
    It’s a revolution, I suppose.
                    C                 G      D
    We’re painted red to fit right in. . . . Whoa.
    I’m breaking in, shaping up, then checking out on the prison bus
    This is it, the apocalypse. . . . Whoa.
