     Ami                              C
  So what’s wrong with taking the back streets.
   G                         D
  You’ll never know if you don’t go.
  Ami                        C

2. It’s a cool place and they say it gets colder
    Ami                     C
   You’re bundled up now but wait ’til you get older.
         G                     D
   But the media men beg to differ
                     Ami                C
   Judging by the hole in the satellite picture.
               G                     D
  The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
                       Ami                        C
  The waters getting warm so you might as well swim.

3. Somebody once asked, could you spare some change for gas
   G                      D              Ami C

   G                  D               Ami               C
   I said yep what a concept I could use a little fuel myself
             G          D         Ami C
   And we could all use a little change.
